#### Overview

In this project I used machine learning methods to capture the high-frequency limit order book dynamics and simple trading strategy to study and analyse the benefits of co-location/Proximity hosting to Matching Engines on HFT.

* Feature Extractor

  * Volatility
  
  * Auto-Correlation

  * Normal Distribution
